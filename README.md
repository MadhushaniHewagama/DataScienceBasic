## Decision Trees
# Types of Classification
    01. Decision Tree
    02. Random Forest
    03. Naive Bayes
    04. KNN(K- Nearest Neighbours)

# CART Algorithm
    How does a tree decide where to split?
        01. Gini Index
        02. Information Gain
        03. Reduction in variance
        04. chi square
    Entropy (measure of impuraty(degree of randomness))(s) = -P(yes)log2P(yes) - P(no)log2P(no)
        here s is total sample space and P(yes) is probability of yes

 
#### Random Forest Use Cases:
    01. Banking
    02. Medicine
    03. Land Use
    04. Marketing
